    <string name="guidance_and_counseling_text">Guidance and Counseling is a process designed to help you gain a greater understanding of yourself, address your concerns,
        and learn effective academic, behavioral, personal and interpersonal coping strategies. It involves a helping relationship between you and a counseling staff
        (registered guidance counselor or trained guidance associate) who has the desire and willingness to help you accomplish your individual goals.\nCounseling involves
        sharing personal information with your guidance counselor. During the course of counseling, there may be periods of anxiety or confusion. The outcome of counseling
        is often positive; however, the level of satisfaction for any individual is not predictable. The success of the counseling goals is usually dependent on the
        participation of the client. Your counselor is available to support you throughout the counseling process. The termination of the counseling shall be after the
        goals are met, or if there is a need for a referral to other professionals, or the client expresses the intention to terminate such.\nAll interactions with Guidance
        and Counseling Services, including scheduling of appointments, content of your sessions, progress in counseling, standardized test results, and individual personal
        records are strictly confidential. No record of counseling is contained in any academic, disciplinary, administrative, personnel, or career placement file. You may
        request in writing that the guidance and counseling staff release specific information about your counseling to persons you designate.
    </string>
    <string name="exceptions_to_confidentiality_text">Because counseling is based on a trusting relationship between the guidance counselor and the client, the former will
        keep information shared by the latter confidential, except in certain situations in which an ethical responsibility limits confidentiality.\n● The guidance
        and counseling staff works as a team. Your guidance counselor may consult with other counseling staff and allied professionals to provide the best possible
        care. These consultations are for professional and training purposes only.\n● If there is evidence of clear and imminent danger of harm and abuse to self and
        /or from others, a guidance counselor is legally required to report this information to the authorities responsible for ensuring safety.\n● A court order,
        issued by a judge, may require the Guidance and Counseling Services staff to release information contained in your record.</string>
